Certainly! Let's explore concurrent requests, async/await, and Promise.all in JavaScript:

1. **Running Concurrent Requests with async/await and Promise.all**:
   - In this article by Brennon Loveless, you'll learn how to make concurrent HTTP requests using async/await and Promise.all.
   - The goal is to fetch data from multiple URLs in parallel. The article covers both serial and parallel approaches.
   - **Concurrency vs. Parallelism**:
     - Concurrency refers to how a single-threaded CPU processes multiple tasks. It emulates parallelism by quickly switching between processes.
     - Parallelism occurs when a CPU has multiple cores and can truly run two tasks simultaneously.
     - JavaScript's event loop makes code seem parallel, even though it's executed concurrently.
   - **Async/Await in Serial**:
     - The following code demonstrates a serial algorithm using async/await:
       ```javascript
       (async () => {
         const urls = [
           "https://example.com/posts/1/",
           "https://example.com/posts/1/tags/",
         ];
         const data = [];
         for (const url of urls) {
           await fetch(url)
             .then((response) => response.json())
             .then((jsonResponse) => data.push(jsonResponse));
         }
         console.log(data);
       })();
       ```
     - While this works, awaiting each fetch call introduces unnecessary delays.
   - **Making It Parallel with Promise.all**:
     - To improve performance, remove the `await` keyword before the `fetch` command. This starts all requests in parallel.
     - Use `Promise.all` to wait for all promises to resolve:
       ```javascript
       (async () => {
         const urls = [
           "https://example.com/posts/1/",
           "https://example.com/posts/1/tags/",
         ];
         const promises = urls.map((url) => fetch(url).then((response) => response.json()));
         const data = await Promise.all(promises);
         console.log(data);
       })();
       ```
     - Now the requests execute concurrently, and `Promise.all` ensures we wait for all responses before proceeding.

2. **How JavaScript Works: Event Loop and Async Programming**:
   - Alexander Zlatkov's article on Medium delves into the event loop and the rise of async programming.
   - It covers five ways to improve coding using async/await.
   - Understanding the event loop is crucial for writing efficient asynchronous code.
