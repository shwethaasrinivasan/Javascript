Implementing a basic file/folder viewer can be approached in several programming environments and languages. For simplicity, I'll describe a web-based solution using JavaScript (for functionality) and HTML/CSS (for structure and styling). This example will be static and won't involve server-side programming or access to the actual file system for security reasons. Instead, we'll mimic a file/folder structure in JavaScript.

Step 1: HTML Structure
Create a basic structure for displaying folders and files.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>File/Folder Viewer</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>

<div id="fileViewer" class="file-viewer"></div>

<script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

Step 2: CSS Styling
Add some basic styles in style.css to differentiate between files and folders.
```css
.folder {
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 5px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.file {
  margin: 5px 10px;
  padding: 3px;
  background-color: #e7e7e7;
  cursor: default;
}

Step 3: JavaScript Logic
Implement the logic to display a file/folder structure in script.js. We'll mimic a file system structure using a JavaScript object and then render it.
```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const fileViewer = document.getElementById('fileViewer');

    const fileSystem = {
        "Folder1": {
            "Subfolder1": {
                "File1.txt": null,
                "File2.txt": null,
            },
            "Subfolder2": {},
            "File3.txt": null,
        },
        "Folder2": {
            "File4.txt": null,
        },
        "File5.txt": null,
    };

    function renderFileSystem(obj, parent) {
        Object.entries(obj).forEach(([key, value]) => {
            const element = document.createElement('div');
            element.textContent = key;
            if (value === null) {
                element.className = 'file';
            } else {
                element.className = 'folder';
                renderFileSystem(value, element);
            }
            parent.appendChild(element);
        });
    }

    renderFileSystem(fileSystem, fileViewer);
});

How It Works:
HTML/CSS: Provides the structure and styling for displaying folders and files.
JavaScript:
Listens for the DOMContentLoaded event to ensure the HTML is fully loaded before attempting to manipulate it.
Defines a fileSystem object that mimics a directory structure, where folders have objects as values, and files have null.
The renderFileSystem function recursively processes the fileSystem object, creating div elements for folders and files, applying appropriate classes, and appending them to their respective parent elements to mimic a nested structure.
Folders are clickable (indicated by the cursor style), but this example doesn't implement expand/collapse functionality for simplicity.
This is a basic implementation. Expanding it could involve adding interactivity (e.g., expanding/collapsing folders), integrating with a server-side file system for a real application, or enhancing the UI/UX with icons and better styles.
