Creating tooltips using only HTML and CSS is straightforward and can be achieved using the :hover pseudo-class to display information when the user hovers over an element. Here's a basic example:

HTML
<div class="tooltip">Hover over me
  <span class="tooltiptext">Tooltip text</span>
</div>

```css
/* Container div to position the tooltip text */
.tooltip {
  position: relative;
  display: inline-block;
  border-bottom: 1px dotted black; /* Optional: adds underline to indicate hoverable */
}

/* Tooltip text styling */
.tooltiptext {
  visibility: hidden;
  width: 120px;
  background-color: black;
  color: #fff;
  text-align: center;
  border-radius: 6px;
  padding: 5px 0;

  /* Position the tooltip text */
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 1;
  bottom: 100%;
  left: 50%;
  margin-left: -60px; /* Use half of the width (120px/2 = 60px), to center the tooltip */

  /* Fade in tooltip - animations (optional) */
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.3s;
}

/* Show the tooltip text when you mouse over the tooltip container */
.tooltip:hover .tooltiptext {
  visibility: visible;
  opacity: 1;
}

Explanation
Structure: A <div> element with a class of .tooltip contains the text that, when hovered, shows the tooltip. The tooltip content is placed inside a <span> element with a class of .tooltiptext.

Styling: The .tooltip is styled to indicate it's hoverable (optional underline). The .tooltiptext is initially hidden (visibility: hidden and opacity: 0) and positioned absolutely with respect to its first positioned (not static) ancestor container (.tooltip div).

Visibility: When the .tooltip container is hovered over, the .tooltiptext becomes visible (visibility: visible and opacity: 1) through CSS transitions, creating a fade-in effect.

Positioning: The tooltip text is centered by setting its left position to 50% of its container and then shifting it back by half its width (margin-left: -60px). Adjust the bottom property to control the vertical distance between the tooltip text and the hoverable element.

This method is purely CSS-driven, providing an elegant and simple way to add tooltips without JavaScript. It's highly customizable and can be adapted to fit the design of most websites.

The display property in CSS specifies how an element is displayed on the web page. inline-block is a value of the display property that combines features of both inline and block layout models. Let's explore why you might use display: inline-block; and the types of layout models related to it.

Why Use display: inline-block;?
Flow Like Inline Elements: Elements with display: inline-block; are placed on the same line as adjacent content (if there's enough space), similar to inline elements like <span>. This allows for more flexible layouts without using floats or changing the document flow drastically.

Dimension Control: Unlike inline elements, which do not allow you to set width, height, or vertical margins/paddings, inline-block elements permit these properties. This makes inline-block particularly useful for creating a grid of items that align well horizontally and have consistent dimensions.

No Line Breaks: inline-block elements don't introduce line breaks before or after the element, allowing for a smoother inline flow with the ability to control dimensions, unlike block elements which consume the full width available and always start on a new line.

Types of Display Values Related to Inline and Block
inline: Elements display in line with the surrounding content without starting on a new line. Width and height properties do not affect inline elements.

block: Elements consume the full width available, regardless of their content, and start on a new line. You can control their width, height, and vertical margins/paddings.

inline-block: Combines the line flow of inline elements with the dimension control of block elements. They flow with the text but can have set dimensions and vertical margin/padding.

none: The element is not displayed at all (it has no effect on layout; similar to removing the element from the document).

flex: Displays an element as a block-level flex container or an inline flex container with inline-flex. It's a more advanced layout model that provides a powerful way to align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.

grid: Displays an element as a block grid container (grid) or an inline grid container (inline-grid). The CSS Grid Layout provides a two-dimensional grid-based layout system, offering a more efficient way to design grid-based user interfaces.

Conclusion
Choosing between inline, block, or inline-block (among other values) depends on the specific layout needs of your content. inline-block is particularly useful when you need elements to lay out inline but also require control over their size and spacing, serving as a hybrid that brings together the best of both worlds. Each display type serves different purposes and can be used in various combinations to achieve the desired layout.
